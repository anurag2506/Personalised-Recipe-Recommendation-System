<h2> Personalised Recipe Recommendation System</h2>

<h4> Basic Overview of the Project</h4>
<p> The project aims at providing users with recipe recommendations tailored to their needs and conditions. Throughout the world, people have different food habits and to cater to each one is the aim of this system. To make these recipes as personalised as possible, we take a couple of inputs from the users regarding the following:<br>
<br> <b>1. Dietary Preferences( Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)</b>
<br> <b>2. Type of Cuisine (Italian, Indian, Chinese etc.)</b>
<br> <b>3. Ingredients Available (Vegatables, spices, fruits and other things)</b>
<br> <b>4. Time available for cooking</b>
<br></p>
